		\begin{solution}
			The similarity of the resistors brings equally potential terminals. Enabling us to just use series and parallel resistance computation.

			4 1000 ohms in parallel = 250,
			2 1000 ohms in parallel = 500
			
			Resistance between A and B equals
			$R = 1000 + 500 + 250 + 250 + 500 + 1000 = 3500 ohms$
		\end{solution}
