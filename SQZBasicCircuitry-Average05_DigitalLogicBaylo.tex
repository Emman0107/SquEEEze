		\begin{solution}
			Divide 2468 by 2 until you arrive with 1, rounding up after every division. The answer is how many divisions it took plus one. \\
			Another solution is to find the nearest $2^{N}$ which is greater than 2468.
			\begin{center}
			\end{center}
			
			Getting the closest N
			$2^{11} = 2048$
			$2^{12} = 4096$
			$N = 12$
		\end{solution}
