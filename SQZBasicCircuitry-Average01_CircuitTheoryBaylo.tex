		\image{image}{Caption}
		
		\begin{solution}
			In each cycle, a full bridge rectifier has two active biased diodes which reduce the output. Since the input is a Â±10Vpp sinusoidal signal, its output should be reduced depending on the total bias voltage of the diodes.
			\begin{center}
			\end{center}
			
			Maximum voltage equals
			$V = 10-0.627-0.627$
			$V = 8.746 V$
		\end{solution}
	
		\finalAns{$8.746 V$}
